# Summary
This repository contains the code used in simulations comparing serologically-triggered versus fixed-time interval long-term COVID-19 vaccination strategies in Mozambique. Our findings are described in this preprint entitled ["Can long-term COVID-19 vaccination be improved by serological surveillance?: a modeling study for Mozambique"](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.29.23294793v1)
